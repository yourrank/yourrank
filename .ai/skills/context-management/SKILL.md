# Context and Session Management

## Maintain
- current goal,
- acceptance criteria,
- completed tasks,
- active task,
- decisions made,
- rejected approaches,
- unresolved risks,
- verification already performed,
- canonical implementations discovered.

## Persist durable facts
Update:
- `PROJECT_STATE.md`
- ADRs when architectural decisions matter.

## Before handoff/compaction
Record:
```text
Done:
In progress:
Next:
Do not redo:
Known failures:
Verification evidence:
```

## Rule
Do not rely on conversation memory for durable architecture decisions.

## Durable truth hierarchy
Persist product/architecture truth in `PROJECT_TRUTH.md`, product UX context in `PRODUCT.md`, visual language in `DESIGN.md`, and changing execution status in `PROJECT_STATE.md`. Do not duplicate the same fact across every file.
